# 🐶 Python OOP Challenge: Digital Pet

Welcome to my Python OOP Challenge submission! 🎉

In this mini-project, I built a **Digital Pet** using Python and object-oriented programming principles. The pet has behaviors like eating, playing, sleeping, and even learning tricks! 🐾

## 🚀 Features

- 🐾 Custom pet name
- 🍖 `eat()` reduces hunger and boosts happiness
- 💤 `sleep()` increases energy
- 🎾 `play()` boosts happiness, reduces energy, and increases hunger
- 📊 `get_status()` shows the pet's current state
- 🎓 `train(trick)` teaches the pet new tricks
- 🧠 `show_tricks()` displays learned tricks
